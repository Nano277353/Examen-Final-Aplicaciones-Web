## Methodology
**Tools/Tech and Languages Used**: 
- Visual Studio Code
- phpmyadmin
- bootstrap
- AdminLTE Template
- HTML/CSS/PHP
- Blowfish Encryption
  
Main website structure was implemented from an **AdminLTE** bootstrap template, allowing for a faster and more agile workflow and focus on the website's features rather than its design. Nevertheless, I put work into customizing the website's appearance so that it would more accurately reflect something that I would like to see. 

The main features in which I worked on during the project's duration were the following:
- User Interface customization.
- User authentication capabilities through php and login page creation.
- User and profiles database creation and integration using phpmyadmin and SQL.
- User password encryption through BLOWFISH encryption method.
- Image file integration to allow profile picture customization.
- Form validation to prevent duplicate registries.

## Repository Content
- Website content files
- Controllers folder
- Compressed template files folder
- CSS and JS customization folders
- Profile pictures folder
- Form validation folder

## Learning
This project helped me better understand different principles and good practices that must be followed in web development, specially relating to:
- UI design
- Database creation and connections through phpmyadmin
- Encryption implementation and security of user data.
- File integration and form validation.
